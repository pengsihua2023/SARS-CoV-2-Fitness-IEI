# Evolving fitness and immune escape: A retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (2020-2024) using protein language model
__Introduction__: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented global health challenges. Understanding SARS-CoV-2’s evolutionary dynamics, particularly its fitness and immune escape, is crucial for effective public health strategies. This study uses advanced protein language models to examine how genetic variations shape viral adaptability and immune resistance.  
Methods: We utilized the CoVFit protein language model to predict Fitness and Immune Escape Index (IEI) values, validated by a null model satisfying the principle of neutral evolution to ensure statistical robustness. We analyzed a dataset of 2,504,278 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences, including 160,892 distinct variants, to evaluate temporal and geographical trends in viral evolution from January 2020 to May 2024.  
Results: Our analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in fitness (mean rising from 0.227 in 2020 to 0.930 in 2024, p < 0.001, KS test) and IEI (mean increasing from 0.308 to 0.482, p < 0.001, KS test) globally, far exceeding null model expectations (fitness mean ≈ 0.405, IEI mean ≈ 0.308), indicating strong selective pressure. North America, contributing 95.46% of cases, showed the most pronounced changes, with fitness peaking at 0.925 and IEI at 0.589 among top variants in 2024, suggesting a potential shift toward evolutionary stability. Globally, the JN.1 lineage dominated (94% of sequences by April 2024), underscoring its evolutionary advantage. 
Conclusions: CoVFit provides critical insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution, supporting vaccine development. The virus’s persistent adaptation despite interventions emphasizes the need for ongoing surveillance and adaptive strategies. Advanced computational tools like CoVFit are essential for enhancing pandemic preparedness.
