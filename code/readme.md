#### KS-test-fitness_mean-v3.py
The code is designed to perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to compare the fitness/IEI distributions of two datasets: randomly generated amino acid mutation sequences under a neutral evolution model and real SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein sequences.
#### Lineage-count-v3.py
This code is for Lineage count from variant sequences.  
#### find-unique-sequence.py
This code is for find unique in the downloaded data set of SARS-cov-2 S protein sequences.   
#### generated-0321-V5-2-final.py
This code is used to generate random amino acid sequences that obey neutral evolution criteria.
